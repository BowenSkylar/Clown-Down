General Assembly Project 1- Clown Down

Clown Down is a new take on the old classic carnival game, ‘Down the Clown’. The objective is to get as many clowns down before time runs out.

In this remake, use your mouse to target each clown, you have 30 seconds to play. 
Once you think you’ve gotten them all, think again! Keep an eye on your clock and may the games begin.

Also viewable on mobile device in landscape mode.
